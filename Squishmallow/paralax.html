        <h1>Hummingbird</h1>
        <p>They are the smallest migrating bird.
            The name, hummingbird, comes from the humming noise their wings make as they beat so fast. Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards. Hummingbirds have no sense of smell. The average weight of a hummingbird is less than a nickel.  An encounter with a hummingbird most often brings good news. If you have recently struggled, a hummingbird may appear to congratulate you for enduring and to tell you that the hard times are behind you. Hummingbirds recognize and remember people when they see a human. Hummingbirds are dreamy and full of creative energy. They strive for beautiful things, they don't want to notice everything bad, ugly and evil and quickly forget. Hummingbirds avoid conflict and confusion.</p>
